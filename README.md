# Networking-Projects
Throughout the course of obtaining a degree, I have done many presentations related to general education, nonverbal communication and more. However, I wanted to aggregate the projects I have related to computing. There will be many more projects built in the future and alterations made to this github, but this is more starting point.
<br>
**If you are seeing this and want a little summary of the presentations, stay tuned!** <br>
## 1.Design Thinking for National Security<br>
  **Problem Faced:** Within the military TOs some parts do not have part numbers, so ordering those parts becomes difficult. Ex: Pouches that go underneath seat pallets do not have a part number 
<br>
  **Goal:** Come up with a solution in order to solve the missing TOs and make it easier for the AF to order those parts that do not have part numbers. Due to limitations with sponsors switching, we altered to having the goal of creating an easier process to collect part numbers and National Stock Numbers (NSNs) into a neat spreadsheet using OCR. 
<br>
  **Interviewing Challenges:** Several interview challenges occured due to many people we reached out too did not have information they could give. Our sponsors also quit the first couple weeks, to where we had to find a backup sponsor. After this, we overcame many challenges and delivered a working solution to obtain at least get some part numbers that were missing.

## 2.Impact of 5G in Smart Cities<br>
**Goal:** To illustrate the impact 5G will have with the ongoing buildout of 5G infrastructure in cities creating Smart Cities.
<br>
**Summary:** With Smart City build out, more devices are connected to networks. With more IOT devices on the network like smart lights, smart sensors, and self driving cars; more data is collected and dispersed. This can potentially lead to security issues, but blockchain technology is key along with homomorphic encryption.
<br>
## 3.Obtaining Suricata IDS Alerts through Discord<br>
**Goal:** Turn Suricata host based IDS into a system that can potentially work away from home. Ultimately, the goal is to connect a device to an AP where the Suricata detection rules and discord alert script is being run on the AP. After the suricata and discord script is running, a device can be connected to the AP hosted on the PIs secondary Wlan1 interface to still gain internet from the PIs Wlan0 interface connecting to router. 
<br>
**Summary:** With Smart City build out, more devices are connected to networks. With more IOT devices on the network like smart lights, smart sensors, and self driving cars; more data is collected and dispersed. This can potentially lead to security issues, but blockchain technology is key along with homomorphic encryption.
<br>
## 4.Ransomware Attacks Explained<br>
**Goal:** Successfully illustrate what ransomware attacks are and how they can be detected.
<br>
**Summary:** Ransomware is when an attacker gains control of a system and locks key files. The attacker then demands a payment in order to unencrypt those files. However, ransomware can be detected via Signature, Anomaly and Traffic based detection. **Signature based** uses already known attack signatures and utilizes an IDS or IPS to be on the lookout for these signatures. **Anomaly based** is also known as behavioral, but looks for patterns of data or endpoints visited. **Traffic based** looks at the ingoing and outgoing traffic for usually a mixture of signature or anomaly based traffic along with floods of packets.
<br>
## 5.Supply Chain Attacks Explained<br>
**Goal:** Successfully explain how Supply Chain Attacks are carried out and briefly are to mitigate against them.
<br>
**Summary:** Supply chain attacks occur when you have a target, but rather than targeting them directly. You target the third party services they utilize and attempt to find exploits in them to ultimately gain information on your real target. The presentation then briefly goes into the Solarwind attack that occured and turned Orion into a trojan horse.
